💼 100 Days, Many Stories: MGNREGA in Data
An Exploratory Data Science Project on Rural Employment Patterns in India
📌 Overview
This project is a deep-dive analysis into the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) dataset, covering multiple states from 2017 to 2022. Using Python and popular data science libraries, the project uncovers trends, anomalies, and insights into rural employment schemes over time.

🎯 Objectives
The project is divided into 6 key objectives, each addressing different aspects of the dataset:
State-wise Employment Distribution (2017–2022)
→ Visual analysis of work demand across states over time.
Annual Trends in Work Demanded
→ Line plot of household demand growth across years.
Fund Allocation vs. Utilization
→ Explored spending patterns and efficiency over time.
Labour Trend & Forecasting with Regression
→ Linear regression analysis to understand future demand.
Heatmap Visualization
→ Correlation heatmap to identify patterns between key variables.
Outlier Detection in Work Demand
→ Used boxplots to detect anomalies in household demands across years.
